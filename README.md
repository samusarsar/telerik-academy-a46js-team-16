## <img src="./images/faq.png"  width="30" height="30"> Frequently Asked Questions

- **Where is the search button? How do I search GIFs?**
  - `GIFlamingo` offers a dynamic search functionality where all you need to do to search is to type in your desired keywords. The search mechanism will dynamically update search results based on your keyword input as you type it in. Easy as pie, right?
- **Why does the favorite bubble opens up a random GIF?**
  - If you haven't yet selected a GIF as your personal favorite, clicking the `Favorite` bubble will present you with a random GIF you might like in the hopes of you finding your favorite as soon as possible.
- **Different favorite GIF and uploaded GIFs only show up on my different browsers - why is that?**
  - `GIFlamingo` stores information regarding your favorite GIF and your profile's uploaded GIFs in the `localStorage()` of your browser. Therefore, a GIF you have chosen as your favorite when opening the website on Google Chrome, will not be recorded as favorite when opening it on Safari, for example.
