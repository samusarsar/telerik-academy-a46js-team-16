# Telerik Academy (A46JS)
## Team 16 Repository

This is the shared repository of Team 16 (Samuil Sarandev & Simona Ilcheva), part of cohort A46 of Telerik Academy's Alpha JavaScript Full-Stack Track.

The repo consists of two starter projects, developed during the earlier stages of the program:
- **GIFlamingo**: a vanilla JS + CSS project, utilizing GIPHY's API.
- **interiorum**: a React + Vite + Firebase forum project, with posting, commenting, and admin dashboard functionalities.

Only [**interiorum**](https://interiorum-6c515.web.app/home) has been deployed, hosted and linked to this repo.

Each of the two projects has a dedicated README file within their respective sub-directories.
